# concurrent structures

hey im db! im currently reading through [Rust: Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/). i also plan to read [The Art of Multicore Processing](https://cs.ipm.ac.ir/asoc2016/Resources/Theartofmulticore.pdf). 


i hope to reimplement many of the structures shown in the books. these include the primitives, as well as the data structures built on top of these primitives.
